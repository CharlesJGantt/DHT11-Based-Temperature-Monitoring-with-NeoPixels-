DHT11 Based Temperature Monitoring with NeoPixels 

Over the last few months I have became infatuated with individually addressable RGB LED strips known as NeoPixels, and their WS2012b generic flavor. I have incorporated them into a product for a business I own, as well as my new custom gaming PC build. I simply can not get over how easy it is to integrate these into projects of every flavor. 

A few days ago, I started working on a environment temperature monitoring project that I wanted to turn into a tutorial here at TMWB, and half way through, I decided to integrate NeoPixels as a sort of basic visual aid. Basically I wanted the NeoPixels to change color based on a hot / cold threshold. While this is simple in function, it will give users an easy way to determine if a room is warm or cool.
